      <description>If you want to be a React Developer, there&#39;s a lot to learn. You can get started in a weekend. Yes, in a single weekend, you can learn React and start developing some cool applications!
Here&#39;s how I would approach it.
Friday Night Ok, instead of binge-watching some TV show Friday night (no judgment, I&#39;ve been there), you could spend the time learning the basics of React. If you&#39;ve never touched React or done anything with it, The Big Picture is the place to start.</description>
