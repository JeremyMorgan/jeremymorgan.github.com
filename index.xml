      <description>If you want to generate static websites (like this blog) then Hugo is the package for you. There are several cool things about Hugo, the biggest being performance. It compiles static sites faster than any other static site generator I&amp;rsquo;ve used.
In the last tutorial, I showed how to set it up and deploy to a small Linux server, and in this article I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to set it up for personal development in Pop!</description>

      <description>Blogging about tech is fun. Having your own blog allows you to help others, polish your skills, and maybe get you a job.
Blogging on other sites such as Medium, Dev.To, etc can be really fun. I do that all the time. But having your OWN site to manage your content is important as well. This gives you freedom to do things exactly as you want, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about losing your content.</description>

      <title>Stop Fearing the Whiteboard. Conquer It.</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time we stopped fearing, complaining, and arguing about whiteboard coding interviews.
With a solid plan, a little skilling up, and some practice, you can master the whiteboard interview. We can argue for days about the validity of this type of interview, but the fact is many organizations require it. So are you going to let this obstacle stop you from getting the job you want? Of course not. Let&amp;rsquo;s tackle the whiteboard interview, and defeat it.</description>

      <title>Can you use FreeBSD for a Developer Machine in 2020?</title>
      <link>https://jeremymorgan.github.io/blog/freebsd/freebsd-developer-2020/</link>

      <description>FreeBSD is a solid choice on a server, and it&amp;rsquo;s ubiquitous in the infrastructure world, but how does it hold up as a desktop machine? As a developer workstation? I found out.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering moving my blog back to a FreeBSD web server. I&amp;rsquo;d hosted it that way for years and recently switched it to a Linux machine so I could make Octopress work properly. It uses some old, outdated Ruby gems, andÂ it just seemed easier.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with WSL</title>
      <link>https://jeremymorgan.github.io/tutorials/linux/tutorials/linux/getting-started-windows-subsystem-linux/</link>

      <description>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is awesome.
It gives you the power to use Linux within your Windows system. A Linux shell can be difficult to learn, but the payoffs are incredible. You can become insanely productive with it. I encourage every Windows developer to give this a try.
Early in my development career, I was a Unix/Linux developer, and I loved working with the shell. In 2010 I was thrust into the world of Windows with GUIS.</description>

      <description>If you want to be a React Developer, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to learn. You can get started in a weekend. Yes, in a single weekend, you can learn React and start developing some cool applications!
Here&amp;rsquo;s how I would approach it.
Friday Night Ok, instead of binge-watching some TV show Friday night (no judgment, I&amp;rsquo;ve been there), you could spend the time learning the basics of React. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never touched React or done anything with it, The Big Picture is the place to start.</description>

      <guid>https://jeremymorgan.github.io/tutorials/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-4-dev-server/</guid>
      <description>In this tutorial, I will show you how to set up a Raspberry Pi 4 as a development (or testing) server. You can use this as a place to push your code and test it in a web browser. For the demo, I&amp;rsquo;ll use a React application, but with a few modifications, you can build just about anything with it.
For this project, I&amp;rsquo;m using a Canakit Raspberry Pi 4 Complete Kit.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s the big deal with Pop!_OS?</title>
      <link>https://jeremymorgan.github.io/blog/linux/pop-os-linux-review/</link>

      <description>A new Linux distribution has been popping up in discussion circles everywhere, it&amp;rsquo;s Pop! OS. What is it and why are people so crazy about it?
I&amp;rsquo;ll give you my first impressions of Pop!_OS and whether I think you should consider it for your development machine.
Pop! OS Saved Me There I was, giving a presentation for a group of people on Blazor earlier this month. I&amp;rsquo;d spilled tea on my Windows laptop a couple days prior, so I did the presentation with my MacBook Pro.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Attacks on my Server</title>

      <description>I was casually doing a security audit on my blog recently and decided to look a little deeper into my security logs. With a bit of Linux command line kung fu, some Golang, and Google sheets, I was able to get a pretty good idea of where the attacks are coming from.
To start, I&amp;rsquo;m using CentOS to host my site, so I checked out /var/log/secure. This log is where authentication logs are stored on my server.</description>

      <description>The Pinebook Pro is a $200 laptop that runs a couple of ARM processors, and it promises a lot. Does it deliver? After what seemed like an eternity waiting, mine arrived and here&amp;rsquo;s what I think.
I used this thing for a few days casually to get a feel for what it&amp;rsquo;s like, and this is my first impression.
As a note, you can get a $100 Pinebook here as well.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m introducing a text / code generation tool that you will fall in love with. If you&amp;rsquo;re a developer or someone who works with text or tabulated data you need this tool.
It&amp;rsquo;s called Nimble Text and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome. Here&amp;rsquo;s how the developer of Nimble Text describes it:
 You can be more awesome at your job by keeping this tool always within reach.
NimbleText is a text manipulation and code generation tool available online or as a free download.</description>

      <title>How Blazor is Going To Change Web Development</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I wrote an article about building and deploying a Blazor app without touching a Windows machine and realized maybe I should take a step back and explain what Blazor is and why anyone would use it. It&amp;rsquo;s still fairly new to most in the front end development world, but it&amp;rsquo;s awesome and you should check it out.
So what is it, exactly? Blazor is a framework from Microsoft that you can use to develop interactive client-side Web UIs with C#.</description>

      <title>Easy CRUD for your Web API with Dapper</title>

      <description>Full disclosure here: I don&amp;rsquo;t like ORMs. If you&amp;rsquo;re building an enormous enterprise project, you should absolutely use an ORM. If you have data you really care about and a complex, monstrous system using something like Entity Framework can save you a lot of frustration. If you&amp;rsquo;re building a simple application, or some home project it&amp;rsquo;s really unnecessary.
Recently I found an ORM that I really like: Dapper. It&amp;rsquo;s small, simple, and fast.</description>

      <description>Today Iâm going to show you how to monitor ambient room temperature with a Raspberry Pi. Weâre going to wire up a temperature sensor, gather temperature values and send them to Firebase. This could be the start of a weather station or other crazy experiments. In my case weâre going to check the temperature of a room to make sure our newborn puppies donât get too hot or cold during the day.</description>

      <description>Ok, I admit this is a pretty obscure one but this came up for a task at work today and I had forgotten exactly how to do this. I Googled around a bit and found a lot of answers I either didn&amp;rsquo;t understand completely or just seemed too complicated for what I was trying to accomplish. I had done this with the boost libraries before but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have them on this machine so I wanted a clean, stdlib type solution.</description>

      <description>What is an array? Arrays are common to almost every programming language. An array is simply an ordered map of values, indexed so you can find these values, called elements. These elements can be of multiple datatypes, and can be ordered any way you want.
Array([a] =&amp;gt; 1[b] =&amp;gt; 2[c] =&amp;gt; 3)The Two types of arrays in PHP There are two types of arrays in PHP, associative and enumerative.</description>

      <description>I ping a lot of RPC Services when I post. If you dont know what an RPC ping is, read here. This is a good way to let these services know you&amp;rsquo;ve updated. While it may not be necessary to use all these sites, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to have them. Here is a list of 254 services good at the time of this writing.
