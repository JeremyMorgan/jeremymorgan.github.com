      <p>The Pinebook Pro is a $200 laptop that runs a couple of ARM processors, and it promises a lot. Does it deliver? After what seemed like an eternity waiting, <a href="http://bit.ly/NewPinebookPro">mine arrived</a> and here's what I think.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I used this thing for a few days casually to get a feel for what it's like, and this is my first impression.</p>
<p>As a note, you can get a <a href="http://bit.ly/PinebookSpecs">$100 Pinebook here</a> as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>Before I start reviewing this thing, you may not be familiar with what it is. The Pinebook is an open-source project (hardware and software are open-source) that aims to build usable laptops at the lowest possible price.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pine64/pinebook-pro-review-01.jpg" alt="Pinebook Pro Review"></p>
<p>The Pinebook Pro has a Rockchip RK3399 (SOC) and a Mali T860 MP4 GPU, both ARM platform processors. It has 4GB of RAM, a 1080p display, and magnesium alloy shell body. This is the model I'm talking about in this article. You can get the <a href="http://bit.ly/PinebookProSpecs">full specifications here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to rip this thing open to check it out. Click on the image to see a larger view.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As you might have guessed, there's very little inside this thing; it's the small Pine board, a battery, the touchpad, and a USB controller. My hope is when newer Pine64 systems come out, we can swap them here, but I don't know if it's a possibility. So it looks to be simple and serviceable.</p>
<h2 id="what-am-i-using-it-for">What am I using it for?</h2>
<p>Another important consideration for a good review is a use case. If I were using this for gaming or editing video, it wouldn't be a great review. I decided to spend a few evenings in my free time using it as my living room/goof around laptop.</p>
<p>Here's what I did with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web browsing</li>
<li>Checking email/social media</li>
<li>Building web apps</li>
<li>Writing</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to see if I could grab this lightweight little laptop and do everyday things with it, and it worked well. How much stuff could I realistically do with this $200 computer? The fact that it only runs <a href="http://bit.ly/PSLinuxFundamentals">Linux</a> doesn't bother me as my usual &ldquo;goof around&rdquo; laptop is also running Linux. So I put it to the test.</p>
<h2 id="look-and-feel">Look and Feel</h2>
<p><img src="/images/pine64/pinebook-pro-review-03.jpg" alt="Pinebook Pro Review"></p>
<p>First off, the case is an alloy shell, bottom is metal top is plastic. It's difficult to describe but this laptop doesn't &ldquo;feel&rdquo; cheap at all. There is no loose feeling or rattling when you shake it. The keys are firm and clicky. The hinges feel sturdy and smooth. It weighs a couple of pounds. Though I haven't tried it, I'm confident I could throw this thing in my backpack, lug it around, and use it whenever without worry.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pine64/pinebook-pro-review-04.jpg" alt="Pinebook Pro Review"></p>
<p>The display has no dead pixels and it looks good at night. As far as hardware goes, <strong>so far, everything has worked</strong>. The USB ports, the card reader, power supply, everything. Zero hardware problems. This is awesome.</p>
<p>The only mouse I had lying around was a Microsoft (ironically) Bluetooth mouse. I connected it, and it's worked flawlessly every time I needed it. The touchpad worked fine, but I have big hands and can never get used to them, so I disabled it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pine64/pinebook-pro-review-05.jpg" alt="Pinebook Pro Review"></p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>I haven't done any official benchmarks, but instead just went about usual work to see what stood out.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pine64/pinebook-pro-review-06.jpg" alt="Pinebook Pro Review"></p>
<p>With everything I did, nothing was slow or unusually laggy. This included things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching Videos</li>
<li>Browsing the web</li>
<li>Installing software</li>
<li>Compiling code</li>
<li>Minor graphic work in Gimp</li>
<li>Run a web server</li>
</ul>
<p>It did all of these things smoothly and without problems. This answers the burning question of most of you probably reading this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I use this for a web development machine?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can! It runs Nginx, Node, NPM, Docker, Visual Studio Code and other text editors. Which brings me to my next point:</p>
<h2 id="software-availability">Software Availability</h2>
<p><img src="/images/pine64/pinebook-pro-review-07.jpg" alt="Pinebook Pro Review"></p>
<p>There are quite a few software packages you can't get on this laptop. You can't fault the Pine64; everything has to be built for ARM and that's still a work in progress.</p>
<p>Note, I originally wrote that I couldn't get Visual Studio Code on this, however <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/hyqfrq/my_review_pinebook_pro_200_arm_powered">feoh from Lobsters</a> helped me out. You can <a href="http://bit.ly/VSCodeForARM">get Visual Studio Code with a one liner here</a>.</p>
<p>I used the standard version of Debian 9.11 Stretch that came pre-installed with the laptop. I'm sure I'll swap it out with Manjaro soon enough. It works well, but the packages lag. I manually installed GoLang 1.13 because it only had 1.8 available in the Debian repos. Node in the repos is at v4.8.2, but you can manually install the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">ARMv7 binaries</a> and it appears to work fine.</p>
<p>Again, not a fault of the Pine64, but Debian and ARM package availability.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have since <a href="http://bit.ly/ManjaroInstall">installed Manjaro</a> on it, and it works great!!</p>
<h2 id="final-verdict">Final Verdict</h2>
<p>This laptop is better than any $200 laptop should be. It's high-quality construction and it feels polished. You can tell a lot of effort has gone into making the Pinebook work. There are no errors or glitches you usually find in cutting edge, experimental things like the Pinebook.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pine64/pinebook-pro-review-08.jpg" alt="Pinebook Pro Review"></p>
<p>I'm told <a href="http://bit.ly/ThePine64Battery">the battery should last 8-10 hours</a>, and I have discharged it a few times and it hits the mark. Power usage is impressive.</p>
<p>I used it as a browser, built some applications with it, and I'm writing this article on it. I do believe if someone really wanted to get into software/web development and only had a $200 budget for a machine, this would be the one to get. Hands down.</p>
<p>I'm hoping they can get to a point to go into mass production. I worked on the Classmate PC Project years ago, where Intel tried to create low-cost laptops for underserved regions of the world, and we would have given anything for functionality like this. It's a step closer.</p>
<p><strong>I love it.</strong></p>
