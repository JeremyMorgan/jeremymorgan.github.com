<h3>Classes and Objects - What&#8217;s the difference?</h3>

<p>A class is a template that creates state and behavior for your types. An object is an instance of that class. The best analogy I&#8217;ve heard is the cookie cutter analogy: a class is the cookie cutter itself. It defines the shape of the cookie, and the cookies you produce are objects. For instance you may have a star shaped cookie cutter, rectangular or round. Each of those could be classes, and the object (the cookie) is an instance of those classes.</p>

<p>You can create multiple instances of a class (objects) and each one holds a different state, but has the same behaviors as the class as defined. Classes define types, and objects are an instance of that type.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With software projects it&#8217;s rare that a failure can be pointed a single cause, or a certain person. Usually it&#8217;s a culmination of many smaller mistakes. With technology and formal project management, best practices are usually well documented and available, but one thing that isn&#8217;t talked about as much is attitude. The attitude of persons in your group or your group as a whole is one of the biggest factors of your success.</p>

<p>As a volunteer firefighter my training often intersects with my career in development. It happens more than you might think, and today while taking a class (L-180 Wildland Fire Leadership Development) I learned about a set of &#8220;hazardous attitudes&#8221; that can often get teams in trouble. Reading through it I could see the parallel with software development very clearly. These attitudes on the fireground can get yourself or others killed, so they&#8217;re especially important for everyone to keep in mind, but why not apply them seriously to software development?</p>

<h3>Hazardous Attitudes</h3>

<p>Here is the list of some hazardous attitudes from the class, and this is what we&#8217;ll be applying to software projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Invulnerability</li>
<li>Anti-Authority</li>
<li>Impulsiveness</li>
<li>Macho (competitive)</li>
<li>Resignation</li>
<li>Complacency (casualness)</li>
<li>Escalation of commitment (target, fixation, mission-itis)</li>
<li>Other ( sexist, racist, agency bias )</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&#8217;ve ever worked on a group project of any type, you&#8217;ve seen these. These types of attitudes also tank software projects just as bad.</p>

<br />


<h4>Invulnerability</h4>

<p>&#8220;This would never happen to us&#8221;. Very common especially with teams who have had some level of previous success. They know of the pitfalls, know the risks and still take chances thinking the worst won&#8217;t happen to them. While this might work for a while or even a long time, the backfire can be devastating. Because you took a risk you know you shouldn&#8217;t have it looks very bad when it fails. You are guaranteed to hear the phrase &#8220;You should have known better&#8221;.</p>

<br />


<h4>Anti-Authority</h4>

<p>&#8220;Those guys are a bunch of idiots!&#8221; These words are often uttered about executives, directors, VPs and other forms of upper management. While it may be true that you know more details about your job, there&#8217;s a really good chance you don&#8217;t know what they know about the business, and the reasons behind their leadership decisions. While it&#8217;s healthy to question policy and ask questions of your leadership, willful denial of their rules or requests can be detrimental to your project, and your employment status. When this attitude gets carried away bad things tend to happen.</p>

<br />


<h4>Impulsiveness</h4>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just do it! Shoot from the hip!&#8221; This attitude is sometimes disguised well as a &#8220;can do&#8221; attitude. Often times impulsive managers and staff are referred to as &#8220;go getters&#8221; who really get work done. While that may often be the case, truly impulsive decisions that aren&#8217;t well thought out lead you down paths that are very difficult to get out of. Remember it&#8217;s not just the immediate decision that can backfire, it&#8217;s often the subsequent actions and decisions that really get you into trouble with this attitude.</p>

<br />


<h4>Macho (Competitive)</h4>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll really show them how it&#8217;s done&#8221;. This attitude gets you in trouble mostly because you are using a bias, and it&#8217;s another dangerous road to go down. You may get overconfident and step on a lot of toes thinking you&#8217;re going to hit a home run, and then everyone will forget earlier transgressions cheer your victory. This rarely happens in practice. What usually happens is you alienate people who could be collaborating with and destroying your reputation when you fail.</p>

<br />


<h4>Resignation</h4>

<p>&#8220;This is never going to work anyway, so why try?&#8221;. While the downsides to this attitude is pretty obvious, what most people don&#8217;t consider is how well this can take hold and spin out of your control. A single team member who possesses this attitude can eventually infect the whole group. If not corrected, this attitude becomes a self fulfilling prophecy very quickly.</p>

<br />


<h4>Complacency</h4>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done this a million times&#8221;. Many folks possess this attitude after getting good at something. When working at a lumber mill I was told the people who get injured the most are the ones with the most repetitive jobs that they&#8217;ve been doing forever. They simply quit caring and become complacent to the point they aren&#8217;t paying attention to what they&#8217;re doing. In the business world this can lead to serious bugs and security problems being introduced. Complacent team members are among the most well known.</p>

<br />


<h4>Escalation of Commitment</h4>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve come this far so we as well keep going!&#8221;. This attitude may have the best of intentions, but we usually end up in projects that are over budget and way beyond the deadline. Remember Brooks&#8217; law? Adding more programmers to a late project usually makes it later. And usually the action taken with a failing project is to start throwing money, time and programmers at it until it finishes and nobody is happy with the final product.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just have to know when it&#8217;s time to go back to the drawing board.</p>

<br />


<h4>Other (sexist, racist, agency bias)</h4>

<p>Remove &#8220;agency&#8221; and replace it with &#8220;group&#8221; and you have a problem that&#8217;s extremely common in today&#8217;s business environment. &#8220;Those marketing idiots! Those salespeople!&#8221;. This kind of bias doesn&#8217;t help anyone involved. You should be sharing a common goal not fighting against each other.</p>

<p>Racism and sexism? Remember you&#8217;re a professional, and it&#8217;s 2013. These views are antiquated and ignorant. These views towards your coworkers only creates a bias that harms everyone around you, and your decisions should never be based on them. Not only should you not harbor this bias but you should not allow others to do it. There&#8217;s a reason people can be fired immediately for racist or sexist comments, it&#8217;s a poison that destroys groups, companies, and morale. It inflicts personal damage to others. Be better than that.</p>

<br />


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Reading through these hazardous attitudes it&#8217;s very likely you&#8217;ve already seen it in action. If you have any of these attitudes you&#8217;re contributing to the destruction of your project and group. If you see these attitudes in others and take no steps to correct it you&#8217;re also doing harm. Their is no single recipe for guaranteed software project success, but attitude is a key element. If you have the problems, fix them. If you see it, say something. Lead by example and remember success favors the prepared.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What is Technical Debt?</h2>

<p>Technical debt is a metaphor for the result of taking shortcuts in your development that you&#8217;ll have to fix later, creating &#8220;debt&#8221; that has to be paid off. In keeping with that metaphor you often have &#8220;interest&#8221; that must be paid on that debt whenever extra time is added to work around the bad implementation in the first place. It usually starts with the phrase &#8220;we&#8217;ll fix that later&#8221; and often goes unresolved.</p>

<p>Technical debt usually takes some time to manifest, but once it does you&#8217;ll find yourself spending an exponentially larger amount of time creating workarounds.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://images.jeremymorgan.com/technical-debt-1.jpg" title="Technical Debt" ></p>

<p>In this diagram we can see a couple of applications. As you can see we have a common database class that has abstracted methods to connect to the database. This is good practice, as these functions are often repeated across applications.</p>

<h2>How Technical Debt Happens</h2>

<p>Technical debt is a long and slow process that rarely happens overnight. But a few bad decisions up front can lead to larger problems later.</p>

<h3>The beginnings</h3>

<p>As application 1 is being developed, the programmer takes the wise choice of creating an abstract database connector he or she can reuse later. The class is developed to accept parameters defining each connection. Then the programmer moves on and creates the rest of application 1.</p>

<p>During testing it&#8217;s found that the database returns some strange results under certain circumstances. The programmer evaluates the problem and determines they can do one of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fix the problem by altering the database schema and reworking the code to properly handle this case. This may take a few days.</p></li>
<li><p>Hack up a quick fix that works around the issue and only takes an hour.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>About this time the project manager says the CEO is waiting for this application and it needs to be finished promptly. The developer remembers that there are still 5 more features that need to be added and the design needs to be finished. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do the workaround then fix it later&#8221;. We&#8217;ve all been there, including me. The programmer has saved 3 days of valuable development time, but the application gets completed and we move on.</p>

<h3>Piling it up</h3>

<p>So now a few months later we start to develop application 2. Remembering we have our database class already completed, we simply extend and develop application 2. We layout a model, and build our framework and start testing our application. Suddenly we notice that there is some strange output again from that same database query method. What should we do?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fix the problem by altering two database schemas and reworking the code on both projects to properly handle this case. We must coordinate our change so that there are no unexpected side effects from this refactoring. This may take a week.</p></li>
<li><p>Hack up a quick fix that works around the issue and only takes an hour.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Again the programmer feels the pressure from a looming deadline. We don&#8217;t want to explain to the boss why there is a delay, and that it&#8217;s our fault. So it gets hacked and duct taped again.</p>

<h3>Now we&#8217;re underwater</h3>

<p>A year later, we have 6 applications that are all sharing different abstracted parts of code. We have attempted to refactor the database class a couple times and it ended up breaking parts of the other applications. So we put workarounds on top of our workarounds. We make small changes for one application and the others go down. The CEO sees it and is rightly furious. How can we fix it? Wipe it out and start over?</p>

<p>At this point you&#8217;re looking at weeks or possibly months of work. During this time no new projects will be completed. It&#8217;s dead time that&#8217;s impossible to justify to your management. Yet project number 7 is an application that ostensibly should take 2 weeks, and instead it&#8217;s taken 6. The project manager is furious, the developers are unhappy and the software is a mess. So who is at fault? Everyone involved. Poor planning, unrealistic expectations and shortcuts is what got us to this point.</p>

<h2>So how do we avoid this?</h2>

<p>If you ask ten programmers how to avoid and fix this you&#8217;ll probably get ten different answers. There have been debates for decades about it, but one thing most can agree on is the fact that shortcuts are bad. Here are a few ways to avoid this problem.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Create a programmer utopia</strong> - All programmers are given as much time as they need to develop perfect code that applies all the best practices and teachings of the last 50 years of academic research on software development. It might take months for a simple CRUD app, but rest assured it will be the most beautiful and perfect CRUD app you&#8217;ve ever laid eyes on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Silo development for everything</strong> - Create software on an ad-hoc basis and reuse nothing. Abstract nothing, and build every application as a self standing independent application. Each application is developed by a single person for a single purpose. Don&#8217;t ever try to change platforms, databases or languages used and avoid any broad changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do it right the first time</strong> - Plan your software as much as you can. Establish requirements and stick to them. Build with future scaling and reuse in mind. Decouple as much as possible, reuse what you can and test accordingly. If you have a problem, refactor and fix it as soon as possible, and don&#8217;t stop working on it until it is right. Test everything and retest it every single time a change is made.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So which one do you think you should choose? I have over simplified it here for the sake of brevity but these are all good ways to avoid the technical debt sinkhole that so many companies end up in.</p>

<p>Here are some hard fast rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establish realistic expectations</li>
<li>Gather requirements and get them in writing.</li>
<li>Set priorities and stick to them.</li>
<li>Plan for the worst, it might happen.</li>
<li>Plan for change, it will happen.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t rely on workarounds</li>
<li>Test. Use structured, measurable testing techniques</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t wait to refactor</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t patch it to push it out the door</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t overlook fixes because features were added</li>
</ul>


<h3>Who is at fault for technical debt again?</h3>

<p>  Technical debt is usually the fault of nearly everyone involved in a project. It starts with unrealistic expectations from management, increased pressure from project managers, and programmers who are either under the gun, lazy, inexperienced, or some combination of those factors.</p>

<p>  But these things all stem from the good intentions of everyone involved. The CEO wants to ensure the survival and growth of the company. Management wants to make sure goals are met at a reasonable expense for the company. Project managers want to produce lots of work to show management they&#8217;re making it happen. Programmers want to create cool stuff. Everyone wants to produce things (if they don&#8217;t they shouldn&#8217;t be working there) but experience teaches us how to collaborate to make it work.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Technical debt is a killer. It wastes your company resources, angers your boss, confuses your project managers. It causes programmers to become frustrated and lose pride in their work. It causes projects to take longer and longer to develop.</p>

<p>The power is in your hands as a programmer to push back and try to avoid this pitfall. A simple investment of time up front can prevent massive problems later on. If you inherit technical debt (at some point in your career you will) you absolutely need to make the case to freeze development and fix problems, even if it&#8217;s just one small problem at a time. In fact, that may be the only way you&#8217;ll ever get it done. One method at a time.</p>
