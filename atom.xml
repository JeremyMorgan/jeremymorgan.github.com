    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my GitHub blog, and I&#8217;m not entirely sure what I&#8217;ll put here yet. It will more than likely be a few short musings on the state of the industry, or views on some new technology I find, or just the coolest links of that day.</p>

<p>There likely won&#8217;t be any drawn out huge articles or tutorials as I&#8217;ll probably save those on JeremyMorgan.com.</p>

<p>I will however be talking about Github projects, including some of my own. I hope to meet new people through this awesome service, and hope to teach and be taught as well.</p>
